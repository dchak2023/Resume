# 🌐 My First Portfolio Website

Welcome to **my very first personal portfolio website**, crafted entirely using **pure HTML5**! 🚀  
This project marks the beginning of my web development journey, where I’ve combined creativity and code to build a simple yet effective online presence.

## 📁 About the Project

This is a static website built using **only HTML5** — no CSS frameworks, JavaScript, or libraries involved!  
The goal was to create a clean and structured webpage to showcase:

- 🧑‍💻 A short introduction about me  
- 🛠️ My skills and interests  
- 📫 Contact information

This project helped me understand the foundational structure of webpages and how to use semantic HTML5 elements effectively.
