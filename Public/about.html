    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>As a Service Desk Analyst at HCLTech, I specialize in providing technical support and ensuring seamless IT operations for businesses. I have a strong foundation in troubleshooting, incident management, and customer service, allowing me to deliver efficient solutions to complex IT challenges. <br>
<br>
        Alongside my current role, I am actively upskilling in the DevOps field, exploring cloud technologies, automation, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code. My goal is to transition into a DevOps role where I can bridge the gap between development and operations, enhancing efficiency and collaboration through automation. <br>
<br> 
        I am always eager to learn, adapt, and grow in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Letâ€™s connect and exchange ideas! <br>
